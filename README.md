## About Crawler APP

This is a simple website single page built using the ReactJS library. It contains the frontend that consumes the [Crawler API](https://cryptic-badlands-15292.herokuapp.com/getData) get data endpoint.

## Getting started

- Apache/Nginx.
- Verify to have the proper permission in your network to access the [crawler app](https://tentreecrowlerapp.herokuapp.com/).
- Verify to have the proper permission in your network to access the [source webpage](https://tentreem.mywhc.ca/devtest/products/).


### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`
